title: Memory Snapshot (beta)
---

This feature is currently in beta and focus on API first workflows.  
We can enable it for you upon request, please contact us at team@viewcomfy.com to enable it.
### How it works:
The first 3 cold-starts are going to take longer than the usual ones but after that, the cold-start will be improved in about 60% to 80% than the regular ones, because instead of loading everything from scratch we start from an already loaded state of the memory.
