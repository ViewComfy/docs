One of the key advantages of using ViewComfy is that you can easily turn any complex Comfy workflow into a web app without having to write a line of code. Every ViewComfy app deployed on our cloud comes with a built-in user management system. 

By default, their usage will be charged to the account hosting the app. But on request, they can also be fitted with a separate payment system. 

Any [deployment](/deployment/description) can easily be turned into an app. These are the key steps: 
- [Build and edit](/viewcomfy_apps/build_and_edit): Making ViewComfy apps
- [Deploy](/viewcomfy_apps/deploy): Deploying apps on the cloud
- [share](/viewcomfy_apps/share): Sharing apps with clients, colleagues and more. 

## Open Source Solution
At its core, ViewComfy apps are open-source and can be deployed anywhere. You can also connect them to a local installation of ComfyUI instead of using the ViewComfy API. You can refer to our [repo](https://github.com/ViewComfy/ViewComfy) for more details on how to use the open-source implementation.
