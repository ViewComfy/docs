Each [deployment](/deployments/description) can be used as a flexible, cloud-based, Comfy workspace. By accessing it with the Comfy interface, you can use it as you would locally. You can install new node packs with the manager, add new models and build new workflows. The content you generate there will be saved in your output folder.
