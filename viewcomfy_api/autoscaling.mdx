The ViewComfy Serverless API can automatically scale up and down based on the demand.

The parameters to configure the auto scaling are:
- **Queue size**: the maximum number of requests that can be queued before a new GPU is turned on, by default it is 1. 
- **Max number of GPUs**: the maximum number of GPUs that can be turned on at the same time, by default it is 1.
- **Min number of GPUs**: the minimum number of GPUs that should be turned on, by default it is 0. If this value is greater than 0, new users logging in to your application won't experience a cold start, but billing will be higher.
- **Idle time**: the number of seconds of idle time before GPUs are turned off, by default it is 30 seconds. This means that a GPU will wait 30 seconds after it is done processing its last request before turning off. If GPUs wait longer before turning off, your users will experience fewer cold starts, but billing will be higher. 

New GPUs will turn on automatically when the number of queued requests exceeds the target queue size. Once the infrastructure reaches the set maximum number of GPUs, it will stop scaling, and new requests will be queued. 

When a GPU is idle for longer than the target idle time, it will turn off. Once the infrastructure reaches the set minimum number of GPUs, it will stop scaling down. 

## Example 1:
```
Settings:
queue size: 1
max number of GPUs: 4.
min number of GPUs: 0
idle time: 30

Event: 
10 requests come in at the same time.
```

Letâ€™s say you get 10 requests at the same time, and you don't have any GPUs running; 4 GPUs will be turned on right away and process the jobs.
 
Each time a GPU finishes a job, it will get a new one from the queue until the queue is empty. Once the queue is empty, if a GPU is idle for more than 30 seconds it will turn off. This process will repeat itself until all the GPUs are off. 


## Example 2:
```
Settings:
queue size: 2
max number of GPUs: 4.
min number of GPUs: 0
idle time: 30

Event: 
2 requests come in at the same time, followed by 2 others.
```
In this case, because the set queue size is not bigger than the number of requests, only 1 GPU will turn on. The second request will wait for the first one to finish before being sent to the same GPU. 

If a new set of 2 requests comes in before the first one is finished, the queue will grow to 3, and a new GPU will be turned on. The jobs will then be processed in the order they arrived until the queue is empty. At this point, the infrastructure will start scaling down until there are no more GPUs running.
