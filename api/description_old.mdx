# ViewComfy Serverless API

The Serverless API is designed to reliably auto scale up when your endpoint has a high demand and scale down to 0 GPU instances when there is no demand.  
With our serverless API you will only pay for the GPU instances that are being used.

## Features
- Scale up and down to 0 GPU instances when there is no demand
- Support bursty endpoints with high demand
- Get realtime logs of the execution of your workflow
