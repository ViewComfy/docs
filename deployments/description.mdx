ViewComfy deployments are the Comfy workflows you have accessible on the platform. In a nutshell, they are an installation of Comfy with a set of custom nodes and Python dependency attached to them. Each deployment has access to all the models from the team. 

Each deployment can be accessed via the Comfy interface, an API endpoint or through a ViewComfy app.
