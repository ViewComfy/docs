'og:title': 'Closed Source Models Access on ViewComfy'
---

You can access most closed source models as soon as they are available directly inside ViewComfy.

ComfyUI’s own API Nodes are supported when you’re working inside the Comfy interface on our platform, but for technical reasons, they can't be used when turning workflows into APIs or Apps. For this, you can use our own set of nodes that work seamlessly with ViewComfy deployments.
With these nodes, you can:

- Call closed-source models as soon as they become available. 

- Deploy Comfy workflows that use closed source models as serverless APIs

- Make custom ViewComfy apps that use those models

- Scale usage without worrying about API key management or infrastructure
