# Default Custom Nodes

All new ComfyUI deployments come with a curated set of custom nodes pre-installed. These nodes have been specifically chosen because they are:

- **Very popular** - Widely used by the ComfyUI community
- **Highly compatible** - Work seamlessly with the vast majority of other node packs
- **Performance-friendly** - Don't negatively impact deployment performance

## Adding Additional Nodes

While these default nodes cover most common use cases, you can always install additional custom nodes through the ComfyUI Manager interface in your deployment. Most dependencies can be added directly from the manager, but if you encounter any issues, please contact us at team@viewcomfy.com.
