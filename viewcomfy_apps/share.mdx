Everyone in your team will have access to your app. 

If you want to share your app so that the recipient only has access to the app and nothing else, you can invite them via email. By doing so, they will become viewer users. These users can open the app and use it, but won't be able to see your dashboards. 

To share an app via email and create a viewer user, click on the  "Invite Users" bottom at the top right of the screen.
