The model volume is shared across your team. This means that any present and future deployment inside a given team has access to all the models from the volume.

## Adding models
You can add models at any time using the "add model" button next to any deployment. 

ViewComfy uses the same folder structure as ComfyUI, and all your models will automatically be added to the "ComfyUI/models" folder. This means that if you want to add a lora named "mylora.safetensors", the download path will be "loras/mylora.safetensors".

## Browsing models
To see the models you have in storage, go to "Model Storage" section of the dashboard.
