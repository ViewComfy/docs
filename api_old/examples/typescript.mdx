We offer a TypeScript code to get the API working out of the box. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ViewComfy/cloud-public/tree/main/ViewComfy_API).

You only need to download the api.ts code and you can use that in your project.  

The [workflow_api_parameters_creator.ts](https://github.com/ViewComfy/cloud-public/blob/main/ViewComfy_API/Node-TypeScript/workflow_api_parameters_creator.ts) will help you get the parameters of your workflow_api.json
