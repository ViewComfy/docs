ViewComfy deployments are installations of Comfy with a set of custom nodes and Python dependencies attached to them. They can be seen as an optimised environment to run a specific workflow. Each deployment has access to all the models from the team.

Deployments can be accessed via the Comfy interface, API endpoints or through ViewComfy apps.
