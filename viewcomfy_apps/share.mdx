Everyone in your team will have access to your app. 

If you want to share your app so that the recipient only has access to the app and nothing else, you can invite them via email. By doing so, they will become playground users. 

Playground users can only access your app hub and use the apps available there. They can't see your dashboards. 

To share an app via email and create a playground user, click on the "Invite Users" botton at the top right of the screen.
