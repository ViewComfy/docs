We offer a Python code to get the API working out of the box. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ViewComfy/cloud-public/tree/main/ViewComfy_API).

You only need to download the api.py code and the requirements.txt file, and you can use that in your project.

the api.py code relies on the httpx library, so you will need to install it first:

```bash
pip install httpx==0.28.1
```

The [workflow_parameters_maker.py](https://github.com/ViewComfy/cloud-public/blob/main/ViewComfy_API/Python/workflow_parameters_maker.py) will help you get the parameters of your workflow_api.json

```bash
python workflow_parameters_maker.py --workflow_api_path "<Path to your workflow_api.json file>"
```
