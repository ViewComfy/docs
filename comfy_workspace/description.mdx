Each deployment can be used as a flexible, cloud-based, Comfy workspace. By accessing it with the ComfyUI interface, you can use it as you would in a local installation. You can install new node packs with the manager, add new models and build new workflows. The content you generate there will be saved in your output folder. 

You can also log in to your Comfy account and use API nodes from the deployment.
