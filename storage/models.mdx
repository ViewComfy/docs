The model volume is shared across your team. This means that any present and future deployment inside a given team has access to all the models from the volume.

## Adding models
You can add models at any time using the "add model" button next to any deployment. 

## Viewing models
To see the models inside the volume, open the Comfy interface and navigate to the "model library".
