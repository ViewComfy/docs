To add a model to your deployment, you simply need to click the "Add a model" button next to it and put the download URL. 

We support download URLs from HuggingFace, CivitAI or any other custom buckets you might have. In most cases, you will also need to add a token for the download to happen. The main exception to that rule is public models from HuggingFace; for those, you won't need a token.

If you want to add a private model from your local computer, we recommend first uploading it to HuggingFace and downloading it from there. 

[This](https://youtu.be/sRticjuabVQ) video goes through all the processes one step at a time (including how to upload a private model to HuggingFace).  

All deployments in a team share the same model volume, meaning that if you add a model to one deployment, that model will be available to all present and future deployments inside your team.
