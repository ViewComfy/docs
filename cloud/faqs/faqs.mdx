# How do I know if my instance is running?

After you deploy a workflow, its status changes to "ready". This means that everything you need to run the workflow is installed and ready to go. In that state, you do not incur any charges.

The workflow only runs when the ComfyUI or the ViewComfy interface is **open**. When that is the case, its status will change to "running". To stop it, you just have to close the browser tab with the interface. 

If you are using the API, the workflow will be running from the moment it receives a request and will shut down automatically 30 seconds after processing the last request in the queue. 

# What if my workflow does not show when I open the ComfyUI interface?

If your workflow is not loading when you open the ComfyUI interface, you can download it from the "Workflow files" column on the "Your workflows" page and drop it in ComfyUI.

# How do I delete a workflow?

As long as a deployment is not "running" you are not being charged for it. If you want to delete a deployment to replace it with a new one, you can message us at team@viewcomfy.com with the email address you used to sign up.
