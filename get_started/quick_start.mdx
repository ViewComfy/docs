## Deploying Your Workflow

1. Login to the ViewComfy [dashboard](https://app.viewcomfy.com/)
2. Deploy your `workflow_api.json` file under the "Deploy your own" or use a Templates such as the "ComfyUI: Base Installation" to build a workflow from scratch
3. Once deployment is complete, access the ComfyUI interface
   - Note: The interface will initially show the default workflow
   - To load your workflow, drag and drop your `workflow_api.json/workflow.json` file onto the canvas
   - You can find your file in the "Your Workflows" tab under "Workflow Files"

4. Test your workflow in the ComfyUI interface to verify everything works correctly
   - The Manager is fully functional for installing custom nodes, pip packages and models
   - Add models through the dashboard using the "Add a Model" button in the "Your Workflows" tab

## Storage and Models

- All workflows within a team share the same model storage
- Models downloaded for one workflow can be used in others without re-downloading
- The ComfyUI input folder uses shared storage with the same properties as the model storage

## API and Value Management
When running your workflow through our API or ViewComfy Web app:
- By default, the workflow_api.json you used at deployment, with all of it's values will be run.
- Provided values will override the `workflow_api.json` default values.
- Any unspecified values will use the defaults from the original `workflow_api.json`

## Building Your ViewComfy Web App

You have two options:
1. Clone the project from [GitHub](https://github.com/ViewComfy/ViewComfy)
2. Use the [online editor](https://editor.viewcomfy.com/)
   - Note: The online editor currently doesn't support workflow playground testing
   - For full playground functionality, use the local version

## Deploying your ViewComfy App

1. After workflow deployment:
   - Get your API keys from the "Your Workflows" tab
   - Copy the "API Endpoint" URL to the ViewComfy App's Endpoint field

2. Finalizing your app:
   - Download the `view_comfy.json` file from the editor
   - Go to ViewComfy Apps in the dashboard
   - Click "Deploy App"

## Team Management

- Use the "Invite Users" button in "ViewComfy Apps" tab to add team members
- Team members must accept invitations to access the app
- Team members added that way can only access the app, not the dashboard
